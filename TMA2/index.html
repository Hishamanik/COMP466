            <ul>
                <li>
                    Step 1: Install XAMPP and then open the XAMPP from the start menu.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Step 2: Start the Apache and MySQL Modules. 
                    <em>Note: You might need to change your port 80 to 8080 and 443 to 4443 if you have skype installed in your system.</em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Step 3: Copy all the files to htdocs in the location where the XAMPP program is installed
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Step 4: Go the phpmyadmin webiste by visiting http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin and create new databases called task1_db and task2_db. Then copy the the files data of task1_db and task2_db inside part 1 and part 2 directory in their respective SQL box in phpmyadmin.
                    This will create my MYSQL databases that will be used by the server.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>

                Interpretation(Par1):  In the second part of the project I developed a small-scale online learning management system 
                that can be used to deliver online courses to learners.

                Analysis and Design: The wesbite has a evenly style across all its pages and the logo appears across all its pages to give it a professionla look. 
                It also begins with a image to give a warm message and provides the meaning for the webpage. First technical step I had to to take is to design a SME-friendly language for marking up educational materials 
                Once the user signs in with their email and password which is shown in a nicely formated form type page they can view their courses and add contentes. 
            </li>
   
            <li>
                In this part of assignment we developed a online learning management system that can be used to deliver online courses to learners.
